# ReactJS-Project-Template
A React.js project template or "boilerplate" created without relying on the use of the create-react-app CLI tool. This is done via webpack, babel, and a variety of other tools for a basic minimal setup. This is a good option when you want a very custom specific requirements project that is not restricted by the create-react-app boilerplate.
